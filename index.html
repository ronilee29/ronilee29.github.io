  <h3>Can i give you a call baby?</h3>
  <h4>By: Roni Lee</h4>
  
  <p>two weeks ago that was you and me
    
baby is someone else calling you baby
    
    goodbye's never easy</p>

<p>don't try to save me
can i call you baby?
  can you be my friend?</p>

<p>let me show you love
i’ll be there, whenever you want me
i need somebody who can love me at my worst
  I know i’m not perfect</p>

<p>an actual baby
or in a relationship?
  i never call humans that, just my cat.</p>
